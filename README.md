# COVID-19 Fake News

Using Machine Learning to detect COVID-19 Fake News.

# Background

The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has been accompanied by a large number of misleading and false information about the virus,especially through social media . The same technology we rely on to stay informed,productive and connected is enabling and amplifying fake news that continue to undermine the global health response and jeopardizes measures to control the pandemic. In fact, the spread of misleading information about the virus has led the World Health Organization to warn of an on-going "infodemic" or an overabundance of information, both online and offline. 

Misinformation cost lives. Without the appropriate trust and correct information, diagnostic test go unused,immunization campaigns to promote effective vaccines will not meet their targets,and the virus will continue to thrive.
