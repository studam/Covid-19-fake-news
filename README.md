# Introduction

The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has been accompanied by a large number of misleading and false information about the virus,especially through social media . The same technology we rely on to stay informed,productive and connected is enabling and amplifying fake news that continue to undermine the global health response and jeopardizes measures to control the pandemic. In fact, the spreading of misinformation about the virus has led to the World Health Organization warningof of an on-going "infodemic" or an overabundance of information, both online and offline. This includes deliberate attempts to disseminate wrong information ot undermine the public health response and advance alternative agendas of groups or or individuals.
